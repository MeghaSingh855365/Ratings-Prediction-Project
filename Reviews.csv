1,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much

3,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
4,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
5,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
6,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
7,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
8,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
9,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
10,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
11,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
12,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
13,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
14,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
15,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
16,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
17,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
18,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
19,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
20,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
21,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
22,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
23,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
24,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
25,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
26,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
33,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
34,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
35,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
36,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
37,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
38,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
41,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
42,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
43,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
44,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
45,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
46,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
47,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
48,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
49,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
50,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
51,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
52,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
53,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
54,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
55,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
56,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
57,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
58,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
59,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
60,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
61,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
62,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
63,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
64,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
65,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
66,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
67,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
68,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
69,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•.. Overall the laptop is beast because of Nividia GTX 1650 graphics üî•üî•..go for it don't hesitate to buy it's a beast for this price range and...
70,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
71,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
73,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
74,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
75,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
76,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."

78,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
79,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
80,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
81,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
82,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
83,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
84,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
85,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
86,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
87,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected.

88,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
89,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
90,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
91,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
92,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
93,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram

It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow.

All the operations like copy, paste,file unzipping takes more than 2hours. So within one week I have added sdd storage, since it has the compartment for sdd(cost:3k).Now it's super cool laptop at this price. I can able to do multitasking.

Without SSD its very slow, but yiu can still run a lot of things on it, just that yiu have to wait longer on loading screens. My boot time before ssd was around 1.5 to 2 mins, after I put Crucial P5 m.2 nvme ssd , now my boot time is 12 to 15 seconds. The display and keybord are perfect.

103,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
105,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
106,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
108,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
109,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
113,1,Could be better. For solid works it's lagging. I don't know if it can support GTA 5 with ultra graphics. Audio is very disappointing..
114,1,Battery gets drained pretty quick you charge it to 100% and play for 2 hrs and that's it. Well coming to display you will be able to see screen bleed towards edges the processor is good for the price paid and overall you can play almost heavy games better if you add SSD to improve overall performance just battery and display is only concern rest all is pretty good for the price.
115,1,"This is not about the replacement product that I have now.. But about the piece that they delivered first... Everything about it was horrible.... Performance:- 1.

Toshiba hard disc: 71.8 (67%)  Overall- 31st percentile (way below expectations) Everything except the hard disc were horrible/below avg..

So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
118,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
119,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching

It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow.

For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
124,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
125,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."

127,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
128,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
129,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
130,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected.

131,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
132,4,"Honestly, this is a good laptop for multitasking and heavy gaming. But it also has some issues which is need to fixed. I highly suggest you to upgrade RAM (16GB) and SSD.  PROS: 1.

136,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
137,1,It might have great specs but it is slower than 4GB Ram laptops my friends are having. If you are from computer science background tell me how much time should a system take to import a small library like pandas mayb seconds. But it will take 2-3 minutes. It is that slow. Trust me.
138,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that.

162,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
163,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
164,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
165,4,"I have reviewed this product after 7 days. First we should update latest version of nvidia gpu and amd Radeon versions and additionally windows updates also. I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings. If I played this game for long hour, laptop automatically locks and hibernate itlsef it is a major issue in this laptop. Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
166,5,Very nice product in this price range.
167,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
168,5,Beast with beauty
169,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
170,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
171,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
172,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
173,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
174,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
175,5,Just wow! üòç
176,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
177,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
178,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
179,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."

181,2,Booting is very very slow
182,5,Nice product and nice luking
183,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
184,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
185,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
186,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
187,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
188,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
189,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
190,5,Asowm
191,5,Very good product and less price
192,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.

198,1,i dont know why but my laptop is very slow i know there is no ssd but this us too much.. it takes time even to open My pc üò≠üò≠
199,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
200,5,It's awesome...
201,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.
202,5,"Beast üòç 100% I Recommend to buy .Graphics 1650gtx üî•Long Life Battery ...all in one kind this Laptop ..work, travel,gaming suitable ..No heat while play 6hrs Pubg ..you need to careful on edges ..bezel less dat's only problem"
203,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
204,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
205,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
206,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
207,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
208,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
209,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
210,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
211,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
212,5,Awesome laptop
213,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
214,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
215,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
216,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
217,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on
218,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.

224,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
225,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
226,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
280,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
281,1,Sometime Touch Pad is not working
282,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
283,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
284,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
285,1,"Display not work properly, need to change or rectified,   Bed Hp service, I want to return the product, any cost"
286,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
287,1,"Delivery is much delay ... Buy only for coding and other responses , not for gaming.. I recommend to upgrade ssd for gaming.."
288,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
289,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
290,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
291,5,Awesome product
292,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
293,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
294,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
295,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
296,5,Better to put SSD in it
297,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
298,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
299,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
300,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
301,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
302,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
303,4,"Feels premium, looks premium and build quality is good"
304,5,awesome budget gaming laptop I'm so happy

311,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
312,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
313,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
314,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
315,1,Got a cheap and used product usb ports doesn't work well if you try to transfer any file from mobile or pendrive it will show you 24 hours of time and Internet doesn't work either please don't purchase it from this seller
316,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
317,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
318,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
319,5,Nice to handle
320,1,"Absolutely terrible laptop, gta v lagging even on lowest settings.  Quite possibly the worst purchase and very much a scam. The laptop itself does not have enough RAM to even run MS Paint without lag. Do not buy it under any circumstances."
321,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
322,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
323,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
324,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
325,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
326,5,Great quality and good looking device.
327,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
328,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
329,5,Best in price but must add SSD
330,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
331,3,Awesome product.
332,5,Nice one but require ssd
333,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
334,3,Not bad
335,5,Perfect device in this price range
336,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
337,1,Never buy from cheaters like flipkart
338,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
339,5,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
340,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
341,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
342,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
343,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
344,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
345,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast..i myself upgraded to ssd 500gb and 8 gb Ram and now the performance is best"
346,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
347,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
348,5,Goodüî•üî•
349,5,It's adorable
350,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
351,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
352,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good
353,5,Fast delivery and design is very good. It haven't SSD so little bit slower for use. But overall good.
354,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
355,4,Overall best product. One star deducted for late delivery
356,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
357,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
358,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
359,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
360,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
361,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
362,1,Very slow laptop
363,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
364,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
365,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
366,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
367,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
368,1,"Modern laptop need more fast processing ...but my laptop, haha even lots of upgrades I still found it's like 13 processor...it's very slow processing I am a bit unhappy ,it takes nearly 10 minutes to start,...which system now a days take 10 minutes to get in track ."
369,1,The worst purchase I ever made
370,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
371,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
372,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
373,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
374,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
375,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
376,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
377,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
378,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
379,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
380,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
381,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
382,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
383,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
384,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
385,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
386,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
387,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
388,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
389,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
390,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
391,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
392,1,I got a faulty product.
393,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
394,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
395,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
396,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
397,1,"Getting very slow after every 2 or 3 month. Don't purchase, if anyone going for this product"
398,1,its too slow after 3 months of use
399,5,Expect SSD all features are great
400,4,Nice product allover is good but ssd is important
401,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
402,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant
403,1,Worst Laptop For gaming or daily use too. So much hanging issues and lagging issue and booting issue too.
404,1,"Always hanging, not always showing not responding"
405,1,Bit battery backup is low
406,1,Worst model
407,1,"Laptop is tooo slow on both off and on, lag while watching movies, lag on process, many apps and software are not responding"
408,1,"Very bad item, it's got stuck every time and responding time is tooo large it's totally waste of money pls üôècheck before you buy"
409,4,Good performance.
410,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
411,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???
412,1,Not buy this product Buy ssd laptop
413,1,Worst laptop don't buy it at all
414,1,Poor laptop
415,1,In last 6 months it has crashed twice. How can HP make such a product
416,1,Flipart People are frauds.
417,1,Speed Not good.
418,1,I been using these product it's completely slow not worth of money you may regret after buying these product
419,1,"Slow working battery drain,"
420,4,Super laptop at this price range...must buy no issues yet...
421,1,"Performance is pathetic while working with AI or photoshop. I think Flipkart is worst in handling fake product supplier, I think Flipkart actually receives handsome margin through supplier that‚Äôs why promoting it through its platform"
422,5,"This is a, budget gaming laptop"
423,5,Nice laptop
424,3,Best product
425,1,Waste of money
426,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."
427,1,Very bad
428,5,If you add SSD then it becomes beast
429,1,The performance of a brand new unit was pathetic. The purple backlit sucks. The font on keyboard is not comfortable. Had to run a check with HP assistant. I dont recommend
430,2,"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open."
431,1,Bad hp company Westez money
432,1,Performance is slow
433,5,Excellent
434,1,Speakers are not working !!
435,4,Nice
436,2,2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ
437,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
438,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
439,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
440,4,Except battery all features are good.
441,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
442,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
443,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
444,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
445,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
446,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
447,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
448,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
449,5,Very gud product
450,5,Nice but login slow
451,5,Good working
452,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
453,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
454,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
455,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
456,5,Best one
457,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
458,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
459,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
460,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
461,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
462,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
463,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
464,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder
465,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
466,5,Best for 3D work
467,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
468,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
469,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."
470,5,Overall good performance
471,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
472,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
473,3,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
474,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
475,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
476,5,Bad
477,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
478,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
479,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
480,1,very bad laptop not working properly do not believe in ryzen 5
481,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
482,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
483,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
484,1,"Defective product received Battery issues, Heating issue, performance issue, total waste"
485,1,Use less laptop company . Waste of whole money
486,1,Performance is extremely slow
487,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version

491,1,Laptop is horrible . performance is very slow . My camera stopped working within 10 days. Don't buy this .
492,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
493,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
494,5,Best laptop for College students
495,4,Best laptop for students
496,4,Best laptop in th 50000
497,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
498,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
499,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
500,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
501,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
502,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
503,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
504,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
505,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
506,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
507,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
508,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good

514,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
515,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
516,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
517,5,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
518,5,Good
519,5,Just wow
520,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore.

577,5,Good product.....you can go for it
578,5,It is best laptop for gaming
579,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
580,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
581,3,Not for value for money
582,2,I think it is refreshing

611,5,Good
612,5,Good for gaming and Web designing but it takes little more time to start and shutdown
613,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.

624,5,best gaming laptop
625,1,Worst performance
626,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
627,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
628,1,Never buy ryzen processor it takes half of your ram like if you have 8gb you get only 6gb ram I did a big mistake please you don't do it
629,3,Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...
630,3,Battery life is too bad
631,1,Waste of money not worth buying Too slow more bugs
632,5,Good laptop for this price
633,4,Speed is slow compare to others due to HSD however SSD can be further install.Display is very good and keyboard light is also attractive. Over all its good product in this price range.

646,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
647,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
648,1,Worst... product....super slow...don't waste money
649,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
650,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.
651,5,Looks so premium can't go wrong with this
652,1,It so slow and display also have some issues!   I didn't expected about battery . Battery backup is also very less .IG it give only 1 hour backup!  Don't buy!
653,1,"Waste of money. I want to buy a gaming laptop from my childhood. It was my dream, after saving enough money i ordered this laptop and i was very disappointed. Games not running smoothly sometimes game freezes for couple of seconds while playing. Sometimes even if i don't play a game it hangs."
654,1,less Battery backup and after 15 days from date of purchase charger stop working
655,1,The Hard Drive is very slow!!! It's terribly bad for a gaming laptop. I won't suggest buying this product. It just lags a lot!
656,1,"Fan would make lots of noise, just after 20 odd days of delivery. And there's no support from the HP as well as flipkart team. You won't be able to work on laptop because of noise, I'm trying to register a complaint about this but they're not taking care of it. Please don't buy it."
657,1,"worst laptop ever. you cant even run small games on this laptop. even restart take about 5 min. you cant even play pubg pc in the very low setting. gg hp, they said it has 8GB of ram but 2.1GB of was already occupied by unknown hardware. I should have returned this waste of plastic if know it cant even run a single game."

It's not going past the welcome screen. I tried everything but it's stuck at welcome. The laptop asked for an update and it all started from there. I installed just one game and played it less than 1 hr. I am really upset and angry"
665,1,Worst than anything

674,5,Loving it...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
675,1,system hangs on normal usage. forget about games. just chrome with 6-7 tabs. ram was said 8 gb but ur task manager shows max as 5.9G. I think it is taken for some other processing. note over this 2.6G taken by windows with no apps open. so u will be left with meager 2 gb for all ur application. very bad decision going with rysen and windows 10. also this is not ssd but I was expecting little faster boot time. my old i3 lap with win 7 starts faster. bad decision choosing the product
676,1,Display and Performance is awesome but battery sucks

707,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..

The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."

764,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
765,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
766,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
767,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
768,5,Very slow processor
769,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
770,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
771,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring

773,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
774,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
775,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
776,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
777,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times.

852,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
853,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
854,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
855,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
856,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
857,1,"Worst laptop, battery over heating, booting problem, worst build quality üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
858,1,Overall good product
859,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
860,1,It is a worst laptop it gives only 5 minutes of gameing
861,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
862,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
863,1,Don't wast your money this laptop too slow even if 8gb ram and 4gb navidia  Hp service too bad and take more time to reply  This is made in china product don't buy it and easy your money
864,1,15 days after buying one port stopped working and can't handle heavy games
865,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
866,1,PC is not working properly
867,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
868,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
869,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
870,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
871,1,Worst Laptop I ever purchased Don't Buy It Pls Waste of money It hangs too much
872,5,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
873,1,It's very slow when we edit videos
874,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
875,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
876,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
877,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
878,1,Not able control fan speed manually so the laptop overheating and too many repairs for hp company
879,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
880,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
881,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
882,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
883,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
884,1,"This laptop is very slow , it takes 1/2 mins to open any program and load any software, it is the slowest of all other.. I'm fed up of this. I just bought this 2 weeks ago.. üò†üò† waste of money !! This is very slow, unable to work, it doesn't open any software or programs."
885,1,Got damage battery. Charges very slow about 10% in 1 hour.
886,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
887,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
888,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
889,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
890,1,This is the worst laptop.....works very slow...i m not satisfied...it takes 5 min to boot...
891,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
892,1,"Don't buy this product, laptop is very slow as compre to other and it's keyboard and touchpad is also don't work properly other many software problem"
893,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
894,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
895,1,Very Very Very bad performance. It is very slow you can not play any game and not even use Adobe softwares for working purpose. If you want to buy go with intel processor AMD processor is useless. I am so frustrated with this laptop. Dont waste your money
896,5,Best in all way....
897,4,Best laptop in this priceü•∞ü•∞
898,5,very nice gaming laptop and you know what my little sister poured 1 litre water from the bisleri bottle but then also workking really nice u can say this laptop water proof gaming laptop really i am very happy with this freaking amazing laptop

907,1,After using a year I'm rating this laptop don't buy this product.this is the worst product.donot go on 5star rating.this product is worst
908,2,Very slow
909,1,UPON THE EXPIRY OF ONE YEAR DISPLAY STOPPED WORKING AND COMPANY CLAIMED THAT ITS NOT UNDER WARRENTY. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT BEING A GAMING LAPTOP ALL THE FEATURES MENTIONED ARE TO BE CAPABLE AND DURABLE KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT IS A GAMING LAPTOP. FOR NORMAL USAGE ALSO THE SCREEN STOPPED ALL OF THE SUDDEN AND COSTS ME EXTRA.
910,5,Good
911,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of continuous usage. Very good and nice laptop it has best in class display it also passes the the dead pixel test. Displacement astic performance I play a lot of games in this, CSGO and GTA V.  It can't run call of duty Modern warfare, as ram is only 8GB, out of that too 5.88GB is only usable.  Cons: Ram is low. Only 5.88GB I have the HDD variant, and there is no SSD. So my laptop hangs sometimes, and is slow. Go for the SSD variant  Pros: There is ..."

917,1,Very slow and worst. Pls don't buy this !! Complete waste of money
918,2,"Go for a bit better version of pavilion gaming laptop rather than this one. Only 2 months and I have already replaced a harddisk, frequent lags (too much lagging) and works a bit slow. After windows 11 update it's like potato. Had better expectations from hp. Seriously"
919,1,Very bad product  It‚Äôs super slow and takes 20 mins to start.  Never expected this from a brand like HP‚Ä¶
920,3,"Currently you can find a better laptop at this rate, Avg product, High battery usage if you do some heavy work,  Strong and hard piece."
921,1,Waste of money...!! Never buy this seeing anyone's review...its bad and slow after 3 months u will regret buying this laptop
922,5,"Have been using this for few months now and am loving it. The experience, reliability, and the large screen makes it really cool!"
923,2,"Haven't download any software still hangs a lot after 7months of usage the disk, CPU and memory space always goes to 100"
924,2,Too much hang
925,4,It is very powerful but because off hdd it is litely slow but no problem it Play gta v very easily in any setting
926,4,"Good budget gamming laptop from hp,I am happy with this laptop,"
927,5,I am using this laptop for 1 year now best value for money
928,5,So lets keep it simple fantastic product unless the vents at below it are open enough For gaming can handle everything And If u gaming try rising the laptop slightly to open up the vents which will make the performance noticeable way better multitasking will improve and the hdd kinda slow but when it also given enough breathing room will perform just well so prefer slightly rised like a cardboard roll shud do just fine Overall 10/10 its epic and the specs are just fine to stream and record...
929,5,"This is amazing I can use this laptop no lag,not any issues best laptop I think everyone buy this laptop"
930,5,"Great product , superb result , happy with the purchase ."
931,3,"This laptop has a Nvidia 1650 graphics card but by default internal onboard graphics is preferred by laptop for games. You need to change this setting in Nvidia control center to use Nvidia for graphics and games. Major downside of this laptop is it comes with 5400 rpm hard-disk, which causes it to perform very slow. For those who got this laptop with SSD, no problem for them, but for remaining they need to buy additional SSD to get decent day to day usage performance from this Laptop. Fina..."

949,5,It's very good.. Worth of money
950,2,"Slow start ,"
951,4,Worth the money
952,3,It was really nice I like it
953,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
954,3,It takes too much time to boot up.
955,3,Ok
956,2,Gaming performance was very good since it uses the graphics card. Rest of the normal day to day performance was very bad. The pc runs very slow and lagging even when you open a browser.
957,5,ITEM DELIVERED INTACT AND PERFORMING SATISFACTORILY TILL DATE. NO DEFECT FOUND AS I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 12 MONTHS.
958,5,Very good but take some time to booting

975,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
976,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.
977,4,Just upgrade with SSD then it's great
978,5,I am using this laptop from last 6 months and I must say it worths. If you are looking for gaming laptop then this laptop will the best option for you. You will neet to upgrade with SSD. You can use it for official work also
979,5,Good
980,5,I love it
981,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
982,4,It takes too much time to start
983,5,Good
984,4,Great design and performance. A bit slow boot time.

993,4,It is a very good laptop. Very good in this price range. Don't have too much expectations as mentioned in some other reviews. Only problem is 5.9 gb ram ( 2.1 gb is reserved for integrated GPU.
994,3,average
995,4,You Must have to upgrade the laptop ram for playing high specs games like GTA V and others. BTW nyc design and performance..
996,4,GOOD FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING.. BUT RAM UPGRADE IS NECESSARY FOR REACHING ITS POTENTIAL... ALSO SSD UPGRADATION FOR FASTER BOOTING TIME AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT..... RYZEN 3550H ITSELF IS A GOOD BUDGET PROCESSOR FOR MEDIUM- HIGH GAMING BUT THE PROCESSOR ITSELF TAKE UP 2GB OF RAM AND THE INSTALLED APPS ALSO CONSUMES MORE THAN HALF OF THE RAM SPACE..WHICH LEFT THE USER ONLY 2-3GB OF SPACE... SO BETTER TO UPGRADE... ITS LACKS LIKE HELL IN JUST STOCK 8GB RAM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LAPTOP IS...
997,5,Really very good
998,4,Nice performance but sometimes get stuck when am working on my office domain.. I don't think it's good for gaming purpose... I am giving review after one year of use.. in between battery was draining very fastly.. but customer care helped and resolved quickly.. Tbh look is very cool but sharp edges are there.. packaging was very nice and safe also the delivery was on time... Thanks

Hope it will be better in the ssd version of the same laptop"
1007,5,nice
1008,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."

1032,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...

1043,5,Super laptop at this price segment.
1044,3,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
1045,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
1046,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...

Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."

1061,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.

1067,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...
1068,5,Best gaming laptop in this range..... As everyone said u need a ram and ssd for best performance

1078,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
1079,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
1080,5,Nice but not that much
1081,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.
1082,2,If u want to play games buy ps4 or ps5 more better for games in pc or laptop some does not even work
1083,5,Nice
1084,4,Excellent Product
1085,5,Very good product ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
1086,4,"Amazing laptop in this range but very slow, upgrade to ssd"
1087,3,"Booting time is more, I am not recommending."
1088,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
1089,5,God
1090,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
1091,5,excellent
1092,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
1093,5,This is a budget gaming beast
1094,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
1095,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
1096,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
1097,5,Very good....
1098,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
1099,5,Best Product
1100,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
1101,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
1102,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
1103,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
1104,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
1105,4,Good
1106,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
1107,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
1108,5,Great design with better performance
1109,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
1110,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
1111,4,Aavarage system running slow
1112,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
1113,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
1114,5,Sorry to say this The flipkart coustomer care are not responding properly when it need Am facing the issu with charger It's sparking wile charging cable connected to laptop. Am raised a request several time to Share my issue They are rising a request for call Also schedule time but not a call or massage recived from connesernd.
1115,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
1116,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
1117,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
1118,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
1119,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
1120,2,"Not value for money it is better to order another product System takes to long to open main window,after installing only 1 game (valorant) it started lagging not expected thisüòûbetter order MSI with ssd do not go for hdd laptops if you want gaming laptop"
1121,5,good
1122,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."
1123,4,Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞
1124,5,Nice laptop in good price range . couple of suggestions if you are buying this make sure to avail the gst offer to get the best price and install an ssd for better performance.
1125,5,"Very good laptop, but MS office is not pre-loaded"
1126,5,Nice one for all
1127,5,"Initially i was fed up with my selection, even after adding 8GB of RAM & 1TB SSD, But once i moved the OS to SSD this becomes beast, excellent performance and awesome speed, Still battery will be a problem, but you cannot expect more that this from this budget and configration,  Worth buying..!!!"
1128,4,Really great product üî•
1129,5,Budget laptop. Overall nice..
1130,5,"Due to HDD, performance wise it's bad. Other than that it's worth for money.."
1131,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube. I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance. What I liked the most is it's cooling system. Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."
1132,5,Worthy for Money
1133,5,Good one.
1134,3,"Games are getting lag in more scenarios. In 8 GB of RAM ,Only 5.88GB is usuable."
1135,5,Amazing laptop ..... Just you need to update all driver's and perfomance will enhance 2x .... No heating issue... If you want super fast laptop just upgrade 250 GB SSD worth 3k
1136,5,Superb
1137,5,"Best laptop for mechanical design softwares , go for it"
1138,2,The laptop is very slow. Not worthy
1139,4,"The product is good.. But as highlighted by many other reviewers, laptop is slow because of HDD. Add an additional ssd for operating system and the laptop will work fine."
1140,5,Phisically it looks much better than pic awesome mid weight laptop
1141,5,Nice laptop
1142,5,This laptop is best in this budget and also this lags a lot but we can fix it by upgrading SSD
1143,5,Super working
1144,4,"Overall a value for money product...does not gets heat,good design and build overall"
1145,3,Booting up and opening an app is very slow
1146,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
1147,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
1148,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming

1154,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
1155,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"
1156,4,"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os! But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!"

1168,4,"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available."
1169,5,"After using it for 7 days I can say it's a decent system that said money can get.  Fast and reliable. Processor can't be compared with i5 likes but, it reaches the same performance and graphic card gives a boost to the quality.

And then update it to the fullest (windows - 5gb + update - 5gb) And you are ready to do what you want. Ram upgrade is also available in future. You dont need it today.

1235,4,Good experience with hp Without ssd performance is poor
1236,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1237,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow

1257,5,My keyboard was faulty
1258,3,Heating and lag issue...
1259,5,Nice good laptop
1260,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1261,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1262,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1263,5,It's the beast go for it
1264,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1265,5,beast laptop at this price
1266,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1267,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1268,5,good
1269,5,Great after 1 week of use
1270,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
1271,5,Good products
1272,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1273,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1274,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1275,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1276,5,Very good product value for money
1277,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1278,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1279,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1280,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1281,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1282,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1283,5,Good Product
1284,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1285,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1286,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1287,3,I can play free fire with lag

1308,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device.

1441,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1442,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."

I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1445,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1446,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.

1475,5,"It's superb for entertainment, watching movies & battery performances is so good I am very happy with that.One major problem is that for official work or for the Ph.D scholars I would think it's not good as most of the windows applications are not supported in mac Os system so it would be difficult to run app like Origin,Chemdraw,Peakfit apps (which are not available in apple store excepy chemdraw although you need to pay for this monthly)."

1478,5,"Well it's Apple, so you can't really go wrong with it. Battery definitely lasts for 10 hours. If you're a Windows user, Mac Os will take some getting used to.

1520,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."

You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"

Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1530,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."

1543,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1544,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."

For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1549,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."

Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1552,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1553,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1554,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind.

Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1561,5,it's just a nice product

Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1569,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1570,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."

1632,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1633,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"

1635,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1636,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

1696,5,Bought the macbook for the first time. When i opened it i felt in love with the design and the quality is superb.I feel like a child as i have no idea how to operate a mac os. Mac os is easy to operate and the trackpad is simply WOW. Battery Backup is Excellent.I used it continuously for 3 hrs and the battery drained only 21%. I have more to say but i don't want to make it an essay.
1697,5,Flipkart is an authorized re-seller of apple. and you are getting huge discounts here. What more to say?
1698,5,Best laptop i ever bought...battery life is just extraordinary...super fast processor...SSD128 is more enough if you have an external HDD....only con is the display..could‚Äôve built a better display for this fantastic product. This review is after using the product for 6 months.

1708,4,"It gives me nearly 7 hrs of battery life when I stream on YouTube, Viki etc. Even though it's only dual core yet I have never faced any kind of lag. Best thing is, if you want to do video editing it comes preloaded with iMovie, which in my opinion gets the job done for most of the people who edit videos."

The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."

1750,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
1751,5,I purchased it on last big billion day. After all the offers I just had to pay only 44.5k for this device. For me it is very good value for money deal. My main purpose is office work and just browsing and all. The device actually comes with and outdated chipset. But because of the os integration the device is blazing fast compared to my friends windows laptops with more advanced chipset. I know the main customers of this device must be buying their first mac os device. For those persons like ...

1761,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac.

I suggest not to buy this laptop.
1853,4,"I've purchased this laptop for 45k during big billion day sale and I was lucky to get it at that unbelievable price. Talking about the laptop, in 2018 it is outdated with the hardware and the design but still, it is the best buy if you got this 3 major aspects before going for a laptop : 1) Long battery life 2) Light Weight 3) Versatile Then go for it without thinking about anything else. Yeah, it is not for the gamers. I use it regularly for coding, web and movies and it is doing pretty awes..."

1881,5,amazing and so nice and slim laptop.
1882,5,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."
1883,2,"I have used all Apple products and my experience is quite satisfactory. But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."

1892,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens
1893,5,Cool üòéüòé nice product
1894,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
1895,1,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
1896,1,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
1897,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
1898,2,It work slow
1899,1,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
1900,1,"Please don't buy this product, This laptop has crashed within less than 7 months of its purchase. I would not recommend Apple Air to anyone. I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty. Apple better refund my money on this piece. Macbook Charger gets excessively heat up within 10 min of first use. And Flipkart is asking me to visit apple service centre inst..."
1901,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
1902,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
1903,1,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
1904,4,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
1905,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!

1919,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."

1953,1,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

2073,5,good design
2074,5,best value product
2075,5,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2076,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."
2077,5,"Very nice laptop, Totally worth price. Almost most one year i have used and dint find any issues."

2102,5,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
2103,5,Awesome
2104,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2105,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
2106,5,sexy and hot
2107,3,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
2108,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
2109,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

2147,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
2148,2,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
2149,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
2150,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."
2151,5,"Works flawlessly, I mainly use it for software development üëç"

2153,5,awsm..........
2154,5,Simply Awesome
2155,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
2156,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.
2157,5,Excellent packing by Flipkart.Product is so so good.I love it

2163,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
2164,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2165,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."

Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

2174,5,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
2175,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2176,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2177,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
2178,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.

2180,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2181,5,Impressive!!!
2182,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2183,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
2184,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2185,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2186,1,"While doing new update screen gone blank. Took it to service centre and they said mother board is gone and it will cost 36K from apple care support. This is nonsense and warranty period is just for 1 year after all you are spending so much amount and I got this problem exactly in 14 month from the day of purchase I missed by 2 months, my bad luck. Now my Mac book air is of no use after spending 70K with in just 1 year. Apple should increase the warranty period for manufacturing defects to 2 y..."
2187,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2188,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2189,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2190,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2191,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2192,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2193,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2194,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2195,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2196,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2197,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2198,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2199,5,nice prodect
2200,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2201,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2202,1,Good product but price varies
2203,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2204,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2205,3,Great
2206,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2207,4,Amazing quality
2208,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2209,5,Very nice products.
2210,5,Good but price high
2211,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2212,5,Perfect
2213,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2214,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2215,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2216,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2217,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2218,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
2219,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2220,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2221,1,charget not found
2222,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2223,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2224,2,I think window is better system Crashes
2225,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2226,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2227,5,Superb product
2228,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2229,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2230,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2231,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2232,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2233,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2234,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2235,5,Stunningly superb
2236,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2237,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2238,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
2239,4,It's a good product but not value for money
2240,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2241,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2242,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2243,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2244,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2245,1,not good quality
2246,5,awesome product saves lot of time
2247,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2248,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2249,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

2258,1,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

2289,1,"Never trust flipkart for these products. After 5 months of the purchase my laptop's motherboard is damaged without any reason at all. The charge doesn't stay even for 5 hours. I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."

2294,5,"I had purchased it in Nov. 2020 a& today is 7 June 2021. Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours. (Browsing, Movie, Youtube,Netflix etc.)"

But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2340,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
2341,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2342,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2343,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

2409,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2484,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old.

I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.

2557,5,Excellent Product Mashallah.
2558,5,Excellent products
2559,5,Apple product was very good but I'm full unsatisfied with the delivery it's was very late from the time I ordered soo try to make it quick
2560,5,Fantastic performance
2561,5,Awesome Product...Good for pro person...nice..
2562,5,This MacBook is amazing best lovely
2563,2,Charger getting extremely hot.
2564,5,"It's an amazing product,battery life is awesome. Performance is still great even in 2020. Apple products are never outdated ni matter whatever the year is. Overall loved itüñ§üòç"
2565,5,It's quite wiser to pay more for product from Apple like MacBook Air. Flawless design and performance.
2566,3,I donno why my product is not getting validated on apple coverage site any one else facing the same problm? Btw i liked the macbook air but validation problm
2567,4,"Much better than a windows laptop Display is not so good, Performance is up to mark Battery is amazing Sound is great Touchpad is from another world Transition effects are cool Lightweight Superb build quality"
2568,3,"Product is good bt , Flipkart took too much time to deliver it ,üò°üò°"
2569,4,Overall it's a good product
2570,5,Overall nice laptop for programmers!
2571,4,"Slimmest, Display is above average but battery is fantastic... design is awesome."
2572,4,"Battery lasts only 6 hours with latest Mac os Catalina 10.5.6. My new Mac came with it. And now battery is only about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, its great."
2573,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
2574,5,Amazing
2575,5,Good perched
2576,5,One if the best purchase
2577,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2578,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
2579,1,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display
2580,5,"Suprb Quality As expected.. Nice packaging.. Sexy design.. In case of OS ,For programmers and coders I think the bestest ever laptop I have been using .. Love uh Mac and Flipkart also for giving me a genuine product. Thanks a lot..."
2581,1,Excellent power backup
2582,5,"Loved it!  Delivery executive was way too generous and soft spoken. Both, product and flipkart services (seller inclusive) are superb. Packaging was outstanding. Keep up the good work. Thanks for your service!"
2583,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.
2584,5,Awesome.... Product..... Surely go for it... Who said that Apple is not good.it's awesome... Love it.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2585,5,"It's Lovely ,I purchased for my brother and he is extremely happy with that book.big billion day is really helpful for middle class buyer.."

2588,5,Nice product from Apple very nice coding and very good for students
2589,5,Awesome lappy as expected
2590,1,"It's dead less than 2 years later despite very basis usage. Even the apple support centre isn't able to fix it despite charging 35k. Would recommend not buying. If you do, pls add on the extra insurance."
2591,5,This is so awesome üòä
2592,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.
2593,5,Excellent Dilelivery from Flipkart and Apple No dought on product...
2594,5,Great product
2595,5,Great Machine!
2596,5,Perfect
2597,5,"Having purchased the Mac Book Air, my friend asked me how it is and I just replied with a single word - ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù  That having said, I read above reviews already given and everything about the Mac book Air looks good and many have said that the display could be better but I personally am satisfied with this MacBook. The model is 2017 which misses the fingerprint and Retina display from 2018 model. Pretty decent for android studio for mobile app development. The power on time is impressively lo..."
2598,5,Battery was awesome.. Performance management was really good. Note* Not for gamers.. Rest go blindly...
2599,5,Good laptop. I got it for 56k worth it. Display is not great. You can buy lifetime subscription of office at 2000 for those who are worried about office.
2600,1,I have purchased the product but the screen gets off in between automatically and also when i touch the screen it gives electric shock sometimes
2601,5,Awesome

2619,5,Very good product value for money tough build quality and also give smoother performance
2620,3,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.
2621,5,Mind blowing super.

2643,5,Light as a notebook. Great battery life. Superb performance.
2644,5,Wonderful product by apple sure to sugest other

2646,5,Good quality
2647,5,Well do little research before u buy this laptop..as per ur usage. Till date the specs seems like lil outdated but the performance is like awsm. If you have little budget extended dn I would suggest to go with Mac air 2020. Still it is a value for money deal.
2648,5,Delivery before time with good packing. Product works fine. Got the best deal during big billion sale.
2649,5,Nice product
2650,4,Very very bad display looks are excellent performance is excellent battery life and so too good but this place I have ever seen in this price range

2653,5,Super as thin as air
2654,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
2655,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
2656,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2657,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
2658,5,Worthy of money
2659,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
2660,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
2661,5,Fall in love with this
2662,5,Good
2663,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
2664,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
2665,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
2666,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
2667,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
2668,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
2669,5,Nice product
2670,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."

2675,5,Worth
2676,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
2677,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
2678,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
2679,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
2680,5,Good
2681,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
2682,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
2683,4,good
2684,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
2685,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
2686,5,Macbook air is awesome.
2687,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
2688,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
2689,5,Best
2690,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
2691,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
2692,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
2693,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
2694,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
2695,5,Good
2696,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
2697,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
2698,5,Great product. Just loving it.
2699,5,Nice
2700,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
2701,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
2702,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
2703,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
2704,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
2705,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
2706,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
2707,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
2708,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
2709,5,Very good
2710,5,Good Product.
2711,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
2712,5,Beautiful
2713,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
2714,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
2715,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
2716,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
2717,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

2757,5,Kya bolu it's amazing laptop i ever used
2758,4,Product worth the price Good for business purposes only Not good for editing color grading video editing like that because of the display resolution
2759,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
2760,5,A wonderful product.
2761,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
2762,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
2763,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
2764,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
2765,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
2766,5,Great laptop even in 2020
2767,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

2890,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
2891,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy

2915,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
2916,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
2917,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"

3503,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.

3506,5,Macbook Air is working fine.

4723,4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
4724,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
4725,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...

4732,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
4733,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop

4739,5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...

4760,3,Nice but for light use only
4761,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.

It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications.

On start up it nearly takes 15 mins for any application to open . Hangs continuously . Asus customer service support is also bad , they keep us on hold and never returns the call .

I'm personally not satisfied with this product.
4825,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
4826,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
4827,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
4828,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
4829,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
4830,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
4831,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
4832,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
4833,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
4834,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
4835,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
4836,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
4837,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
4838,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
4839,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
4840,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
4841,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
4842,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
4843,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
4844,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
4845,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
4846,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
4847,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
4848,4,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
4849,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
4850,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
4851,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
4852,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
4853,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
4854,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
4855,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
4856,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
4857,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
4858,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
4859,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
4860,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
4861,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
4862,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p..."
4863,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."
4864,5,I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale . Design wise this is beautiful laptop but handle with extra care Display of this laptop is not bad it is full hd and too bright but viewing angle make me unhappy other wise gud display. Performance of this is gud for beginners but for multitasking i have addes 8 gb 2400mhz ddr4 ram in extra slot now multitasking is very smooth . Battery is weak point in this laptop it last in 2 to 3 hrs max.but if u have very tight budget go for it in place of second ha...
4865,4,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
4866,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
4867,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."
4868,5,Go for it...üî•

4881,4,beyond the level of what is expected. though I bought it for 22990/- with an AMD Ryzen processor it works amazingly. worth for money. no need to spend too much of money unwantedly for Intel Processors.

4889,1,The laptop is average...what's really disappointing is the display...when put on full brightness it still cannot make things bright....bad viewing experience.
4890,5,"I have purchased this laptop on 26.06.2020 , it is very smooth to handle , games can be played , Perfect laptop for daily use I have purchased it for 24990 , Finally you can go for it undoubtedly"

4894,1,Don't Buy.. Very Slow..
4895,1,"Here is my honest review after using this laptop for 6 months(I belong to a technical background)- Extremely disappointed with Leveno. I am regretting after buying this laptop. I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed. Their technical support team (on phone) is very incompetent and inefficient and unable to understand/resolve my issues on call. The issues I have been facing from day 1: 1. Fan does not work and hence the laptop is heating too much. 2. Blu..."

4905,5,simply outstanding......top class performances
4906,1,Very very slow... Fully disappointed plz don't buy. My all money is wasted

4908,4,It just a awesome laptop in budget range It good for students and for daily work ...üòçüòçüòçüòç
4909,3,Battery backup is low. Sound is not good. Performance is OK
4910,5,Laptop is good but it hangs sometimes. Laptop taskbar comes delay in screen
4911,3,Ok.
4912,1,horrible.stopped working within 3 days.
4913,2,I purchased this product 5 days before.very worst experience...bad battery life..I requested for return the product
4914,4,"Everything's are good, only the length of the charger is very short."

Main problem is with its battery lenovo should improve it..."
4918,5,nice product
4919,5,awesome look by lenovo and very fast delivery by flipcart it's loveing
4920,2,my touchpad is not working how to fix it
4921,3,"Display sucks, poor viewing angles, backlight burns through the panel  Battery life is under 4 hours  Otherwise great, Disable antivirus and update windows for faster experience, ram upgrade recommend"
4922,2,After 2 month uses it slow.googl app hi 5 se 10 minute mein open hota hai.
4923,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
4924,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
4925,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
4926,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
4927,1,"Don't think of buying this product. Trust me, you will regret to the deepest point. Highly disappointed with not just Lenovo but Flipkart too."
4928,4,A decent laptop for the money you paid üëçüëç
4929,5,Overall good performance no hanging issue sleek slim light small as per latest laptops comes in this price good with lenovo brand I use lenovo 9-8 years lenovo I have face no issue yeah price is fluctuated but good under 26-27k price
4930,3,Display is awesome. Performance bad Battery average. Overall a decent one.
4931,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
4932,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
4933,5,Good
4934,1,"System performance is really pathetic. For opening one web browser will take 5 minutes after clicking it. Not installed any softwares other than operating system and related files. As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."
4935,3,4GB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. IT SHOULD BE INCREASED UP TO 8GB AS SOME PROGRAMS TAKE LONGER TIME IN STARTING.
4936,1,"Don't go for it Bought it before 6 months, not working now!!!"
4937,3,This is bad
4938,1,"Don't purchase this laptop, running very slow after 1-2 week use"
4939,1,That product is low quality. Slow processor.no need to buy this
4940,1,"Don't buy , worste laptop"
4941,1,Laptop is too slow. Even windows 98 pc is faster than this laptop.
4942,1,Within 8 months keyboard is not working properly Full of hang problem s don't by this don't even where to complaint
4943,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
4944,2,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
4945,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
4946,1,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. After a few months the keypad buttons also don't work properly. It's just full waste of money. It takes 10 minutes to boot. Very slow Device. Go for dell or hp
4947,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
4948,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
4949,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
4950,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
4951,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
4952,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
4953,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
4954,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
4955,1,Simply waste
4956,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
4957,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
4958,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
4959,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
4960,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
4961,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
4962,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
4963,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
4964,5,Go for it.
4965,5,Good
4966,5,Nice
4967,4,Nice
4968,5,Osome product
4969,5,Nice
4970,4,Good laptop in this budget...
4971,5,Awesome
4972,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
4973,3,Little bit slower but value for money
4974,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº

4983,5,Good
4984,5,Nice product
4985,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
4986,4,Best buy for this budget
4987,5,My use is only for drafting I use only ms office For me it's good.

But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."

Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund.

5051,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
5052,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
5053,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
5054,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
5055,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
5056,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.
5057,4,Nice Laptop....
5058,1,One of the worst laptop you can ever buy I don't know if it is because of RYZEN processor I was using Lenovo G5070 and it was working awesome That's why I chose to buy Lenovo again But it seems to be the biggest mistake pls don't buy this

5174,2,I purchased this laptop because of it's price but now I think it was a big mistake if you are reading this I request you not to purchase it. It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine
5175,4,Very nice products
5176,5,"That's value for money......it's not a high performance machine but it's excellent in office,students,home usage,coding,light gameing,watching online content like Amazon prime videos,Netflix...ect.

5177,1,Very very poor performance. Not even worth for 10k. At least i should have have buy good laptop with 10k worth in seconds which performs better. Very very disappointed with the product. I will not at all recommend this worst product. Please Don't go with rating and reviews. Check the performance lively before purchase it.
5178,3,"Iam using this laptop for about 9 months..... Firstly this laptop is not intended for heavy task , usually only for office works and media entertainment...This cannot be used for online class, because it have 0.2MP camera only... Don't use this as soon as booted , it take sometimes to gain its optimised state, It can't be used for multitasking, after windows 20h2 version battery about to be draining fast. If you are having experiencing crashes it is normal,, because 2.6gb of 4gb has been usi..."

5187,2,Battery is too poor
5188,5,After using 10 months i am giving review. Problem- 1.This laptop is good but if you work on multitasking its disk used 100% so you fill like hanging laptop. When you add m.2 SSD this problem will be solved. 2. Its (elan)touchpad driver is not fully integrated with this cpu so it not work fully smoothly.  And all things are good in this laptop.
5189,1,Excellent design Poor performance.. Dead slow Battery charge is nt satisfactory

Good thing about this laptop is it has good screen and performance is also good. Keyboard has number which is again a useful feature for working person. Only thing which flipkart promised & was not fulfilled was it will come with 1 year mcafee antivirus protection it got expired in one month.
5222,4,Best laptop under budget i am using more than 2 months I would suggest u to buy this under an average price

5227,3,"Does not come with McAfee antivirus 1 year subscription free as mentioned in product description but when raised a request by providing screenshots of product description which I took while placing order, Flipkart asked me to purchase McAfee 1yr license and then provide them with invoice which they then refunded to me in wallet, thanks Flipkart, awesome support.

5231,1,"Extremely slow and pathetic laptop. It takes forever to start this laptop. I recorded the lag time for opening applications and was surprised to see how come a laptop be this slow in current times. My 1998 PC is faster than this junk. It takes 1 min 2 sec to open web browser, 38 seconds to open another tab in web browser. around 3 minutes to open zoom meeting and stabilize streaming of online meeting. This is when I have not installed any other application apart from whatever comes packaged ..."

Camera quality good and battery is although not very good just fine and value for money and it is good option to buy. In budget range it is good to have and a good option.
5240,2,"Very slow, bought it for my son for his online class... Its very slow normally his class start 8.45 am..He need to open system by 8.30 am...then only he will be able to attend class in Time...Its a basic laptop..if your are looking for gaming or planning to do something which need performance it will be wrong choice"

5350,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
5351,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
5352,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!

5354,5,Nice product
5355,1,Worst performance
5356,4,Good.......
5357,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
5358,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
5359,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
5360,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
5361,1,Poor defect product
5362,1,"Very bad quility product crusher/mouse stop working in middle of work every day ,also function key not working like F1& F2 ,f3 not working without press fn key,speed is too slow hanging problem"
5363,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
5364,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
5365,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
5366,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
5367,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
5368,3,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
5369,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
5370,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
5371,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
5372,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
5373,3,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
5374,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
5375,4,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
5376,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
5377,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
5378,4,Awesome project
5379,5,the laptop is good.Build quality is also good.battery is average and nicely fast charged.performance is good
5380,5,Best product
5381,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
5382,2,Worst product
5383,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
5384,5,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5
5385,1,"Battery problem, low speed ,don‚Äôt waste a money"
5386,5,One of the the best product on this price range
5387,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
5388,1,Waste of Money
5389,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!
5390,4,Slow but it's ok.
5391,2,Very slow and some time it will struck
5392,3,Sound quality is poor..Battery backup is average..Anti virus free for one month only..
5393,4,Nice Laptop with good built quality and performance. But sound is very low and battery backup not impressive.
5394,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
5395,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
5396,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
5397,5,Not bad
5398,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
5399,5,good one
5400,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
5401,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
5402,5,Superb product lenovo
5403,5,This laptop is not for heavy work.
5404,4,Battery backup is only 4 hours

5427,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
5428,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
5429,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
5430,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
5431,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
5432,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
5433,5,All is well
5434,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
5435,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.

5444,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
5445,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."

5483,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
5484,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
5485,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
5486,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
5487,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
5488,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
5489,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
5490,2,Very very very slow.

5493,4,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

5501,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."

5524,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
5525,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.

5535,3,"Design is good Sometime taking time to open any applicable like office , explorer even system is ideal. Battery is not upto Mark As per price 25k it is good for this product"
5536,2,Bat
5537,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
5538,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
5539,3,Good
5540,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
5541,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
5542,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
5543,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
5544,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay

5546,4,Nyc
5547,5,Awesome laptop..
5548,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
5549,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
5550,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
5551,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
5552,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
5553,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
5554,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
5555,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
5556,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
5557,5,Nice phone i am very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
5558,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
5559,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
5560,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
5561,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
5562,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
5563,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
5564,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
5565,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
5566,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
5567,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..

Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
5570,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
5571,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
5572,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
5573,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
5574,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
5575,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
5576,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"

5578,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
5579,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
5580,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
5581,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
5582,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
5583,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
5584,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
5585,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
5586,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
5587,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it

5590,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
5591,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
5592,5,Very niceüëçüëç
5593,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
5594,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
5595,5,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

5596,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
5597,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
5598,5,Its a great phone at this price range. Worth the price.. amazing camera. Lovely built quality. Loved it!
5599,5,At this price it's a very good product. The quality of its camera is fantastic and battery backup is also good. What i love most about this product is the display superb display full of HD.
5600,5,"If you need a good battery backup for 2 days it's a Excellent device having good processor, but if you are a Music Lover need good high pitch and volume you will be upset. Brightness in sun is also low."
5601,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
5602,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone.

5606,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
5607,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
5608,3,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
5609,4,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
5610,5,Excellent mobile in this price. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is also performing pretty good. Good buy. Value for money. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5611,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

6202,3,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
6203,1,Please don't exchange Mobile on Flipkart they are cheat us
6204,5,Nice product Camera & battery is very good
6205,2,value for money only. if u are looking for avg phone with average speed having 4GB doesn't make any sense. performance is average. Camera quality is worst. If you are looking for a good camera then this choice would be incorrect.
6206,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

6243,2,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

7486,2,Very much disappointed with this product from Mi. Mobile performance is very weak.  Mobile is hanging even for Hill climb racing game(60 mb game) .  Battery performance is very bad.  Camera is not upto the mark and you cannot use more features like zoom in if you use 48 MP camera.  Basic features are also misbehaving frequently.

9217,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
9218,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
9219,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
9220,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
9221,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
9222,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
9223,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
9224,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..

9227,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
9228,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
9229,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."

9234,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
9235,5,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
9236,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1.

9237,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
9238,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
9239,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
9240,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
9241,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
9242,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
9243,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
9244,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
9245,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"

9248,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
9249,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."

9254,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
9255,5,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
9256,4,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
9257,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
9258,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
9259,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
9260,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
9261,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
9262,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
9263,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
9264,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
9265,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
9266,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
9267,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
9268,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
9269,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
9270,4,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
9271,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
9272,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
9273,4,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
9274,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."

Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum.

Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
9283,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved.

9284,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
9285,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
9286,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience.

My old great phone is lenovo k6 power use about 4 year and that's brilliant camera,full hd,lot of features and Extra ordinary battry life but sadly He is no moreüò£üò£ i miss that phone.

9290,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.

9292,5,The most attractive part of this phone is its battery backup..nice premium quality photos and interesting features in it..overall loved the phone and would say its too good and evry penny spent on it is worth it
9293,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."

At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."

9402,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
9403,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."

9434,4,Overall Good phone
9435,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
9436,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
9437,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...

9442,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good

9541,1,Bad phone Hang Battery not Bacap
9542,1,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
9543,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
9544,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
9545,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .
9546,1,Very bad performance app shut on its own i complained but no response from company very bad services
9547,1,Not fantastied with the camera quality.. yepp battery backup is nice.. But we purchased this phone just for camera quality.. Over all This product is not that good as expected..
9548,1,"Product is very bad. Don't buy this item Hanging problem bad camera quality,,üëéüëéüëé"

9550,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
9551,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
9552,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
9553,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
9554,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
9555,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

9562,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
9563,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
9564,3,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

9674,4,1) Without AI activation camera is not to good. Specially in night vision or no light zone. Picture is little bit whitish. 2) System update with mobile data is not available when mobile is in roaming mode. 3) In this price range most allrounder phone. 4) Gaming can be done in medium range graphics. 5) Most efficient processor. 6) Little bit heavy.

Snapdragon 662 is snappy for everyday use and also for playing some heavy games at medium settings. The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

9942,5,Review after using for 3 months:  Pros: 1. Definitely lives up to motorola's legacy of solid build quality 2. Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1. Camera is decent overall with great shots in day and night light but performs...

Camera quality is superb and can click pictures in dark without any issue. Camera quality is good. overall happy with the product,"
10418,2,Camera is not that much good quality as they mentioned in description and they given in the phone. If you looking for good camera quality its not good.

10443,5,"Phone is good enough for attending calls and WhatsApp. I took it for my business purpose, which mainly involves taking a lot of calls and being constantly on WhatsApp and the performance is satisfactory. Don't expect to get crisp photos....it produces decent enough photos. Didn't yet try multi-tasking, but I believe that won't be a problem. If taking more calls and being in touch constantly on WhatsApp is ur main thing, this phone is for u. Great battery, good display, good enough processor....."

Performs smoothly, battery stays for a day (standard use) , camera is decent . Only concern was the Google assistant button (which doesn't add value for my use) . Also, emergency button long press directly triggers emergency call. Took time to figure out that you can turn this off from Gestures. Overall, great buy"

10482,3,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
10483,5,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
10484,5,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
10485,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
10486,4,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
10487,2,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
10488,3,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
10489,5,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit . And osm think is** new advance system is osmü§© ,, *& according to me its good average phone ,, # if you spend more money then i recommend you buy other one üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
10490,2,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
10491,5,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
10492,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
10493,3,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
10494,5,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
10495,3,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
10496,5,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery

10499,5,First of all I really love Motorola This phone is really impressive with its design with its specifications its camera nd most powerful nd loved one is its pure stock android experience with moto customisation options there is no blootwere no adds no lags its pros nd now we discuss about its cons the review is true nd based on i m using various type of phone in this segment nd i also use motorola's many pjones   So the main nd major problem with motorola is hd+ display its really i feel if m...
10500,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
10501,5,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"

12044,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
12045,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
12046,4,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
12047,4,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
12048,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
12049,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
12050,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
12051,5,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"

12054,5,"Motorola has made a good effort to provide a phone in this price range. Overall phone performance is very good in this price. Display is good, battery is good, looks so good, new type of back going feature is nice, Misty blue color is awesome. But they're some issues with the phone which I want to share. The camera quality is very poor. If take a photo in sunlight is good but in little bit in dark photos are very bad. Camera quality is not up to mark. If I think 48 megapixel will work no it w..."
12055,4,In this price range this is one of the best smartphone available on flikart. The camera is also good with night vision available.
12056,4,Very nice
12057,4,Best budget friendly mobile from Moto. The display is quite big and not fit in one hand easily. The camera is much better than Samsung mobile of same range and battery performance is good too.If you like big screen with in 10k you can go for this .
12058,1,"The phone is very bad in all aspects . To start with.  1. Camera : The cameras both front and Back are very bad , blurred and low light and no clarity. They never had proper colors. other brand phones in the price range are very good 2. Poor display and bad colors. 3. No proper Battery back up  4. FlipKart: Product look's like a duplicate product, and flipkart return policy is worst, there is no returns and refund for the product purchased  My humble suggestion please do not see the ratings..."
12059,5,"The display is good, the phone has good weight, feels solid in hand, the processor is decent for day to day use(browsing, internet surfing, etc.) I brought this for my mother and she is happy with it."

12062,1,"Being a Moto user and Moto lover since 6 years, I must say I'm disappointed. Very bad experience with Moto e7 plus since 2 months. Worst part is I exchanged by Moto e5 power which was working perfectly well for this piece of trashü§¶ Terrible display and new user interface. Just not comfortable using it even after 2 months. Please please please do not buy this. Humble request üôè Moto should sell their old models instead of this."
12063,4,"Battery üîã backup good , display good , camera is not good , performance good , network problem , good looking , but no earphone in box within two days received fast delivery tq flipkart"

12065,4,"Overall this phone is great but there are so many features that are missing like audio recording, fm, etc. The most annoying feature is call recording come on why do someone need to know that im recording the call. As soon as you click record it loudly say 'the call is been recorded' except that everything is fine. Camera is good, display is HD+ hardly you will notice any difference. Battery is decent, I like this phone for the UI."

12069,3,"I purchased it for my mother. The comparison was with Narzo20A and redmi 9 prime. But, i choose this one, because it gives clean android. People said, the camera is not good, but I don't find any issues. Charging time more but it also gives good backup. My mother runs it for 2 whole days. Performance is also good. Design is good. Fingerprint sensor can be faster but it runs for parent. Overall, good value for money."
12070,4,Good product Worth for its pricing Nice camera especially night mode very helpfull Decent front camera Battery too good Display ok but if they would have given FHD + great Not for gamers Feels good for daily usage with moto gestures No Ads..

Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

14106,5,Although the stock android experience is amazing it is to be noted that the reception on the phone is very weak given the fact that other phones give much superior results with the same sim.  A big flaw since that's the prime goal of a cell phone.

Battery Backup is very good No useless/Extra Apps Moto Gestures are Excellent Inbuilt Call recording is Present.

14158,5,Best for mid range segment Camera is ok Display is not more bright but ok Overall mobile performance is impressive And more important is working stock android My opinion go for this ( mid range under 9999)

14185,5,The phone is good in this price. Camera :- they are saying 48+2mp camera but the camera is really very bad . Battery :- battery life is quit good but the charger is very poor quality it feels like keypad phones charger. Display :- display is not that smooth but it's good in this price. Looks :- the overall look of the phone is really good you can't tell the price by it's looks . Overall :- the product is really good but I'm not going to say excellent and I'll update if I like or dislike ...

It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."

14981,5,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time. The best part of this device is its premium feel in this range with the solid packaging of the device qhen you use it continuously.

14985,5,With this price range it's a good phone but the face recognition doesn't perform at well in low light and the rare cam doesn't perform at 48 mp instead it works on 32 mp. But for call and video watching and social networking it's doing well. Can't handel heavy games like COD but doing great for candy crush and angry bird. Now upto u. For minimal gaming it's good .
14986,5,Very nice camera & battery backup
14987,3,"Value for price , camera quality is not good."
14988,5,Within 10 days of use this phone started lagging even on basic use like call whatsapp instagram. User interface blanks up after every call.

15381,1,"Phone is Good, but please don't buy mobile from Flipkart and i really had a very bad experience with Flipkart delivery and exchange of my old phone. Though my old phone is perfectly fine they did reduced the exchange value. I never expected such a low class approach from a highly valued ecommerce site like Flipkart. AVOID buying from Flipkart."

15421,5,"Camera is not of 48Mp totally cheated by manufacturer. Phone is for average use, Screen is long, battery backup is average is not up to 5000mah, camera resolution is 48 mexa pixel is totally rubbish. Earlier Moto camera of 8MP is far better than48 MP, screen touches is average. Manufacturer are cheating consumer on 48 MP camera there is no any quality check. Think before to buy it is better to purchase from market. They shows demo of every items."

15452,5,Good product delivered by Flipkart
15453,4,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....
15454,5,Ok
15455,5,"Overall performance good. But some features missing like vibrate when answered,apps lock. Front camera performance average.back camera performance good. Battery backup & display awasome."

15470,5,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

15477,5,Display: One gets a very clear display on this device. Good for streaming and gaming.  Battery: Little disappointed by the battery. Says it 5000mAh but doesn't last that long. Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
15478,5,Best phone in this price
15479,5,Best budget phone in this price
15480,5,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
15481,5,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

No case in Box, No Secondary Microphone But it Takes better photos than the MOTO G9!!! It blows my mind. Compared Well lit and Low lit Photos. In Moto E7 plus, I just have to take a single shot and can expect the photos to look good whereas there is focusing issues in the G9."

Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
15613,5,Very good product
15614,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
15615,4,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
15616,1,Overall superb mobile at this price
15617,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
15618,5,Product is good but delivery was late
15619,3,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

15639,5,Camera is cheap
15640,5,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
15641,5,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
15642,5,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."

15661,5,Ok Ok
15662,5,Nice phone...
15663,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
15664,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates

15670,5,Good in price
15671,5,Budget king
15672,5,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
15673,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
15674,4,Awesome product
15675,5,do not buy completely waste this product

15681,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
15682,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.

19702,2,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
19703,1,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
19704,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
19705,3,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
19706,3,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
19707,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
19708,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
19709,5,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
19710,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
19711,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
19712,5,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
19713,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
19714,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
19715,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
19716,3,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
19717,4,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
19718,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
19719,5,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
19720,4,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
19721,5,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
19722,4,wonderful product
19723,1,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
19724,5,awesome.
19725,4,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
19726,4,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
19727,3,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
19728,5,good
19729,1,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
19730,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
19731,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
19732,5,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
19733,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
19734,1,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
19735,4,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
19736,3,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
19737,5,Great watch to wear üëå
19738,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...
19739,5,"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k...."
19740,5,Loved it
19741,4,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
19742,4,they gave used product
19743,2,it's good.
19744,5,nice smartwatch..
19745,1,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
19746,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
19747,4,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
19748,5,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
19749,4,Good Product
19750,1,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
19751,1,Nice product
19752,1,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
19753,4,Writing this review after using the product for 9 months . The watch used to work almost satisfactorily for most of the period but there was some noticeable glitch in tracking the heart rate on many occasions . After 09 months it's recording of heart rate became completely erratic . It is abnormally high even during sleep . This error has made the watch completely useless as all the vital stats and features are dependent on accurate tracking of heart rate only .
19754,3,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
19755,5,Not supporting for Notifications.
19756,3,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
19757,3,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
19758,5,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
19759,1,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
19760,4,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
19761,2,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
19762,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
19763,4,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
19764,1,not support all mobile model
19765,3,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
19766,4,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
19767,5,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
19768,1,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
19769,1,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
19770,2,It's a good watch.
19771,4,Very inaccurate and unreliable
19772,5,Good product value for money
19773,5,Full features for this cost is value for money
19774,5,Not good start problem ha
19775,2,Value for money. Good product
19776,5,Ok
19777,5,"The activity tracking is good. But the watch's battery is terrible and barely lasts 2 days. Also, the mechanism to remove and attach the straps is the worst."
19778,2,Battery melted in 2 month time and not getting any support from any where.. flipkart customer support is just waste.. they promise to call in some time but never turned up.. facing issue from 1 month but no prevail. Dont purchase any item like that frm flipkart.
19779,5,Just premium awesome
19780,4,Worst quality of Band...... And accessories not available in local market..... I waste my money after 1 month of use..
19781,3,Battery is draining fast
19782,1,Very good. No compromise on Fitbit quality. Good deal.
19783,5,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
19784,1,Value for money
19785,3,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
19786,5,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
19787,3,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
19788,4,Just okay
19789,2,Excellent watch.
19790,4,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
19791,5,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
19792,3,Connectivity is very loose
19793,5,Good product
19794,5,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
19795,3,Good product... resonable price...
19796,2,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
19797,5,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
19798,1,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
19799,5,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
19800,5,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
19801,1,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
19802,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
19803,3,Very nice
19804,1,This watch was Awesome
19805,2,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
19806,5,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
19807,5,Worth buying it
19808,5,It is a good product in this price range.
19809,5,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
19810,2,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
19811,5,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
19812,5,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
19813,3,It's an amazing product
19814,1,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
19815,1,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
19816,1,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
19817,5,Poor battery backup
19818,2,Best watch
19819,3,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
19820,2,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
19821,2,Worth buy and accurate
19822,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
19823,5,Bettery keep charging every day
19824,4,After one year display automatically damaged
19825,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
19826,5,Worst product no recommended
19827,2,Good watch...looks stylish...
19828,2,Beautiful watch...value for money.
19829,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
19830,1,Good one
19831,4,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
19832,5,Okay product
19833,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
19834,5,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
19835,1,Awsome experience....
19836,3,Good watch
19837,5,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
19838,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
19839,5,Not good
19840,5,Waste of buying
19841,4,Nice watch
19842,1,Very nice product...üëç
19843,2,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
19844,1,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
19845,5,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
19846,5,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
19847,4,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
19848,3,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
19849,1,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
19850,4,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
19851,1,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
19852,1,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
19853,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
19854,5,Not good
19855,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
19856,2,Good watch
19857,5,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
19858,1,Worth it....
19859,4,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
19860,4,Nice
19861,1,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
19862,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
19863,1,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
19864,5,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
19865,5,Great product!!
19866,4,Not value for money..
19867,5,Nice watch
19868,4,Amazing
19869,5,Its value for money
19870,2,Thank you flipkart
19871,4,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
19872,5,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
19873,5,It‚Äôs okay
19874,5,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
19875,2,Good So far...Loving it
19876,3,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
19877,4,Very good
19878,1,Classic watch
19879,5,Good product
19880,5,It's wow
19881,5,Classy product.but battery issue seen
19882,4,Nice watch.....
19883,5,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
19884,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
19885,4,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
19886,5,Nice
19887,4,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
19888,5,Nice one
19889,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
19890,5,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
19891,2,Don't buy
19892,5,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
19893,3,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
19894,1,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
19895,2,Wonderful bought at 7300
19896,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
19897,1,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
19898,2,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
19899,5,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
19900,4,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
19901,4,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
19902,3,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
19903,4,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
19904,1,Best at this price
19905,1,Good Simple watch.
19906,5,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
19907,5,Nice
19908,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
19909,4,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
19910,1,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
19911,5,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
19912,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
19913,5,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
19914,3,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
19915,3,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
19916,5,Very nice really good product
19917,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
19918,5,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
19919,2,No doubt... It's best in class
19920,5,Good one
19921,1,Worst product
19922,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
19923,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
19924,5,Not much as expected
19925,1,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
19926,1,Best in class
19927,5,Worst don't buy it
19928,3,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
19929,5,This product waste
19930,5,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
19931,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
19932,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
19933,1,Not worth of the price
19934,1,syncing problem with iphone
19935,1,Amazing watch!
19936,1,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
19937,2,Poor
19938,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
19939,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
19940,2,Breakage product
19941,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
19942,1,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
19943,5,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
19944,3,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
19945,1,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
19946,4,Good product received and worth of money.
19947,1,Totally inaccurate!
19948,2,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
19949,5,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
19950,5,Great watch..durable too
19951,1,Loved it
19952,4,Nice
19953,4,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
19954,5,Money waste
19955,5,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
19956,5,Nyc
19957,5,Very good product
19958,2,Nice watch
19959,1,Nice product
19960,5,Perfect
19961,5,"it's amazing, just go for it"
19962,4,good
19963,4,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
19964,5,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
19965,5,Berry ghatiya product
19966,4,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
19967,1,worth to spend on this product
19968,3,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
19969,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
19970,3,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
19971,4,amazing product
19972,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
19973,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
19974,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
19975,5,Supergood.
19976,5,best
19977,5,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
19978,1,nice
19979,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
19980,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
19981,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
19982,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
19983,5,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
19984,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
19985,2,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
19986,5,super
19987,3,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
19988,5,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
19989,1,great product
19990,5,I just have praises for this watch
19991,5,base users for a activity trackers
19992,4,loving it.
19993,5,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
19994,5,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
19995,4,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
19996,5,good in all aspects.
19997,4,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
19998,1,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
19999,1,ok
20000,4,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
20001,1,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
20002,2,very good product...
20003,4,Connectivity issue.
20004,1,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
20005,4,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
20006,5,super watch and nice color
20007,1,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
20008,4,good one
20009,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
20010,5,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
20011,5,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
20012,4,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
20013,2,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
20014,4,good one
20015,2,good and accurate
20016,1,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
20017,5,very good
20018,5,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
20019,5,Really good watch worth buying
20020,2,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
20021,5,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
20022,1,worth buying....
20023,4,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
20024,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
20025,1,working as per review but little costly
20026,5,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
20027,1,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
20028,1,nice product....
20029,3,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
20030,3,perfect for health reasons
20031,3,super product and delivery on Time üëç
20032,5,go for it guys rocking
20033,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
20034,5,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
20035,5,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
20036,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
20037,1,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
20038,4,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
20039,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
20040,5,good
20041,5,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
20042,5,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
20043,1,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
20044,4,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
20045,2,great product
20046,1,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
20047,5,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
20048,1,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
20049,5,very good product with great features
20050,2,good watch.... only lacking call facility
20051,4,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
20052,5,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
20053,4,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
20054,4,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
20055,5,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
20056,2,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
20057,1,The product was not as per expectation.
20058,1,genuine product
20059,3,Great product
20060,5,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
20061,2,Nice Watch for the Amount
20062,5,awesome.....
20063,5,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
20064,3,Excellent product... good to go
20065,5,nice product
20066,5,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
20067,3,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
20068,5,worst watch
20069,5,stylish and fantastic
20070,2,ok
20071,1,excellent watch
20072,1,best price and good buy
20073,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
20074,4,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
20075,5,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
20076,5,Good
20077,4,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
20078,5,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
20079,3,Not connecting for not working properly
20080,5,Nice product
20081,2,very nice
20082,1,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
20083,1,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
20084,5,Nice watch
20085,5,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.
20086,1,Product is good....look and Activities tracking is nice.
20087,3,beautiful watch
20088,5,Trustworthy companion throughout the clock
20089,1,cool
20090,5,Best smart watch üòçüòçüòç
20091,4,nice product. have been using it for almost a week. got it at a good discounted rate on flipkart.
20092,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
20093,4,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .

20095,5,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
20096,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
20097,5,"product is very good and build quality also , special thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery , best camera for starters , it captures best quality photos"
20098,3,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé
20099,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
20100,5,Awsm . I'm not a professional but using of li'l bit xperience must say that best Dslr in a best budget.perfect for a beginners.image quality is too good.thanx to Canon thanx to Flipkart & also thanx to Ecom xpress for perfect delivery.
20101,5,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.
20102,5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
20103,4,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
20104,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
20105,4,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
20106,5,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
20107,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
20108,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
20109,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
20110,4,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
20111,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
20112,5,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
20113,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
20114,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
20115,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
20116,4,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
20117,5,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
20118,5,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
20119,5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
20120,5,nice one üòç
20121,4,Good camera
20122,4,order canon camera..recieved sony camera...so disappointing
20123,5,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
20124,5,"A decent entry level DSLR. Very glad that it was bundled with a carry case.  The lens is decent for beginner level and some advanced level photography.  For the price I bought it, I can not say how glad I am."
20125,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
20126,1,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
20127,1,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
20128,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
20129,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
20130,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
20131,3,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"

20135,5,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
20136,4,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
20137,5,"This is my first camera in my life. After 3months research i bought camera from Flipkart through EMI . Camera received on republic day . I am very happy to see the first camera in my life . All happiness gone after 10minutes of usage due to camera view finder don't have diopter adjustment as per various human vision so I faced eye irritation,severe headache, blurred vision.cannon kindly consider this is design problem and also bad entry level camera. View finder quality is must must must......."
20138,5,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
20139,3,Very nice camera üì∏ for beginners and picture quality is very good and it's worth buying and build quality is very good üëçüëå And Best camera for family üòä I use this camera from 1 month and I am very satisfied with the camera üì∏ and worth buying with 18-55 lens

20141,1,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
20142,4,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
20143,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service

20148,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.

20152,4,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
20153,5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
20154,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
20155,5,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
20156,5,"Nice Camera in Great Price, Good for photo passionate"
20157,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
20158,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
20159,3,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
20160,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
20161,5,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
20162,4,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
20163,4,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
20164,5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
20165,4,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"
20166,5,Good quality product for the price. Photo quality is commendable and iinbuilt wifi is an advantage as it can be used to wirelessly use camera for capture and data transfer. Even the video quality is very nice at1080p.
20167,5,awesome product very good . thank you flipkart for awesome discount
20168,5,"Happy with the product and quality of the image is also awesome for the beginners.., got free wireless head phone.. thanks üòÉ"
20169,5,Product worth for money. nice clarity and amazing snaps
20170,5,"I have used many of my friends' dslrs to do some photography, and now, since I had to buy one of my own, being a newbie I went for this and boy o boy this camera is brilliant!  for a beginner this wouldnt have hot any better. am completely satisfied with this purchase for I have bought it during BBD'18 and at a jaw dropping prove of 17k. yeah!  thanks Flipkart!"
20171,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.

20426,5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
20427,5,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."

20481,5,"Don't fall in trap with the price,get a used camera,that would be a better option.U can get a 600d or 700d or sony a5100 in this price range with 18-55mm and a 55-250m lens.Think about the future use,u can not plug in mic,it does not have autofocus u can not record videos at 60fps in 1080p also its low light performance is worst.Please don't buy this.Ibought it and now i am regretting."

20488,4,Pixel quality bad when image zooming
20489,5,Camera is super but kindly provide bag and MEMORY Card
20490,5,Nice camera
20491,5,It‚Äôs worth the Price .. leave the kit lens Have to buy separate lens which will b too good with EOS 3000D

20498,1,Good Photo
20499,5,Good
20500,4,Image reasult is awesome Camera quality so good
20501,5,Best camera Best canon camara Eos 3000
20502,5,Love it
20503,4,If you're Planning to buy this camera for video shoot then you are going to do a big mistake because it's video quality is too much poor .
20504,5,Very nice camera... But main thing is that I don't know some of its functions so after using 3-4 months I will give my review again
20505,5,Blur system is very good
20506,4,Good
20507,1,Good product
20508,5,So Nice.I love this
20509,5,Camera is good but storage is not enough camera quality is very nice this is expensive but according to price features very less.
20510,4,Good product for the price range.
20511,5,Super üíï
20512,5,Awesome product i.e. dslr camera at this price . I am using it since 5 months..
20513,3,Awesome in this price range great quality
20514,4,Good
20515,5,Very good photo
20516,5,Wast of mony
20517,4,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
20518,5,Best dslr in low Price
20519,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
20520,1,Excellent product
20521,5,Always guves a crisp image. Best for beginner. And I am a beginner.
20522,5,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
20523,5,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
20524,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."
20525,5,At this price..it is okay.but if you are expecting professional quality fotography then it is not for you..Go for some higher price model.
20526,3,Good product
20527,4,Excellent product the picture is much more good
20528,4,Very good
20529,5,Nice
20530,5,Good for entry level. I bought is super cheap at 19k. Wait for offers.. if want a bit better one go for 1500d

There's no separate power button and viewfinder diopter , it's of a bit problem. Nevertheless , it's the most affordable dslr in the market , and it can compete with any entry level dslr. Thus it's the best pick for a beginner."

21470,5,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."

But picture quality is good for a entry level dslr.

21542,5,"It's a great entry level dslr. If you are new into the photography or video making then you may go for this product. But i would suggest you to buy Canon 1500D, if you can. After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

22280,5,"I'm not good photographer, so with my limited knowledge and usage, I'd say camera is more than value for money. Yes, pics quality is good, in both day & night (using flash). A lens and a camera kit bag which comes as supplement is an added benefit to carry & handle the camera safer during outing. Needless to say flipkart's service as it was delivered as promised!!!! Overall, considering it's price,this camera basic DSLR model, will be useful for the beginners."

Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me... 300mm lens is OK... need to get another one since i mostly do birds.. need more zoom üòä Overall its a great camera for beginners!!!!"
23394,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
23395,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
23396,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
23397,5,"Excellent wow, what a camera! value for money, must buy. best entry lebel camera. flipkart delivery is so fast. very good packaging. no 1 genuine product."
23398,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
23399,5,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
23400,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
23401,5,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
23402,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
23403,4,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
23404,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
23405,4,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
23406,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
23407,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
23408,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
23409,5,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
23410,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
23411,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
23412,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
23413,4,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
23414,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
23415,5,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
23416,5,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...
23417,5,its really a nice camera
23418,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
23419,4,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."
23420,4,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price.

I shoot raw, and post processing the images are coming really well Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me ... 300mm lens is ok... need to get another one since i mostly do birds..need more zoom ‚ò∫Ô∏è overall its a great Camera for beginners!!!"
23423,5,Very nice camera
23424,5,"Best DSLR üì∏ on this range üí∞, I think nikon provide best product in DSLR. Picture was so good I just love with this DSLR"
23425,5,Awosome photography.
23426,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
23427,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
23428,5,Camera nd picture qlty is so nice. Delivery is also fine. This camera fullfill all the need. It work fine nd battery backup also fine. Nikon is best for Picture Quality and colours.
23429,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
23430,5,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
23431,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
23432,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
23433,5,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
23434,4,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
23435,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
23436,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
23437,4,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
23438,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
23439,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
23440,5,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
23441,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
23442,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
23443,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
23444,4,Great product from flipkart and delivery period is very short I just loved flipkart delivery time period.... And also I wants to thank flipkart for the free gift of Samsung Bluetooth headfone.. And have got the Bluetooth headset with the nikon d5600....now just wants to click and enjoy my photography with the camera....
23445,5,"This one is master of Photography with Dual Kit Lens set, it is an amazing tool... awesome picture quality.  good sensor, nice shutter speed, larger range of ISO variation, 60fps video @1080P...makes it an awesome camera"
23446,5,"camera is 5 *, you can read enough on the net. Got at a very good deal , seller also shipped it on time but the courier ecom express delivered late , the outside box (carton ) was also damaged. Thankfully the inside packaging was good enough to prevent any damage. Flipkart and seller should ensure they send it via a reliable courier. I guess people will be willing to pay shipment to see their expensive items delivered on time and w/o damage. Btw I didnt receive any samsung headphone with the ..."
23447,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
23448,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
23449,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
23450,3,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."
23451,5,"superb DSLR ,brought for my daughter very good pic. quality nd video quality with good sound,go for it without any ifs nd buts....... ...u will definitely like this product...."
23452,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
23453,5,"Before time delivery, great service flipkart... Product is great as expected... Good discount... Nice packaging, Got wellness band free... Delighted"
23454,5,Bought the camera in a perfect deal. A nice cam that suits beginner to pro users with a lot many handy features. The 18-55 kit lens delivers a promising performance. I'm very much satisfied with it. Thanks Flipkart for a great deal.
23455,5,Amazing product if one has the budget he should buy this camera with the dual lens because the combo pack is so good. The components was not even touched. and the components were also very clean and brand new the only thing that which I don't like is the proper bill with the guarantee warranty card. I don't get the warranty card inside the box so please mention that point overall the camera was good all the components for not even touched very clean and I will give this product 5 rates. Thank...
23456,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
23457,5,"I am writing this review after using one month. I have bought the camera at 42k with the dslr body & and 18-55mm kit lens. The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments. I'll highly recommend you to buy this product..."
23458,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."

23472,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

Camera is simply awesome and cute in size Light weight Beautiful architecture of camera structure so pleasant in hands never felt bulky Camera bag is provided as complimentary which is a good thing Battery backup is good too I am a beginner so I can't give technical review But I have heard from so many people this is a best camera to become a pro and even I felt the same Touch screen is awesome

23495,5,Nice DSLR. Bag provided is Lowepro NOT Nikon. But lowepro bag is of very good quality. There are two lenses.

We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015.

23536,5,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
23537,5,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
23538,5,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
23539,5,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
23540,1,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
23541,5,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
23542,4,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
23543,4,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
23544,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
23545,1,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
23546,5,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
23547,5,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
23548,5,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
23549,2,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
23550,4,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
23551,5,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
23552,2,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050
23553,5,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
23554,5,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...
23555,4,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
23556,3,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."

23560,5,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
23561,5,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
23562,4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
23563,4,"it's not good Or not bad,,.. It's work too much slower.. but not bad... it's ink Is not working longer ... I'm not happy with this INK problem... Thanks to Flifkart...."
23564,5,Packing is awsome ! Prints a bit slow but thats good enoght for that price ! Works fine
23565,4,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
23566,4,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
23567,2,This printer has helped a lot in my projects.Tjis is a gorgeous printer that I have never seen.The owner of this printer would be very happy and in a favorable mood since from first day of buying this printer.

23569,3,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
23570,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
23571,5,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
23572,5,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options. I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
23573,5,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."

23575,4,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
23576,1,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
23577,5,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
23578,4,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
23579,1,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
23580,3,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."

23598,4,such a nice machine it's not like ricket science easy to install works well compact design BUT it takes 2-3 seconds to dry the ink
23599,4,super nice and super cool
23600,5,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
23601,5,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
23602,5,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
23603,5,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
23604,2,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
23605,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
23606,3,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.
23607,4,I'm a student and this printer is so helping me in project works and my many other works of schools. I like it .
23608,5,"The product is good and very easy to use but when we fill ink and use it causes some destructionions s,I wanted to say is it is good but follow instruction from given paper and also check in youtube how to operate and make it work thank uuuu"
23609,5,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."

23625,4,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."

It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge.

Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
23642,5,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy.

Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy.

23672,5,I am already having RICOH laser printer which takes 0.5 paise for printing.As i need scanner this all in function printer is cheaper than scanner and its colour printer also.So i brought this one. Pros: *)Good Scanner and copy function. *)Color Ink depth is good.You can take passport photos at home. *)Scanning speed is good but Its OK..Not too fast as it needs 20-40 secs. *)Printing speed is better than HP. Cons: *)Slow speed of color printing and Black and white printing is some what faste...
23673,5,hi friends this multifunction printer is very good at working.it is an amazing product....i really love this.its the best product in the range of 2k.every thing is fine with this product but a small pron is that the catridge is a bit costlier to buy....
23674,5,printer is in good condition and its worth of price i got this only for 1800 . by purchasing through mobile app. and this printer is only suitable for home purpose.
23675,5,"It has amazing printing quality to its price value and its light weighted.. Amazing packing by Flipkart. If u r budgeted and looking for a nice printer with all in 3-in-one facility then, this is the best choice. 5 stars"
23676,5,Flipkart delivered this product before in time and in good condition ........... everything is fine ......regarding print quality it is ok and best suit for home purpose......
23677,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.
23678,3,"This printer (Cannon PIXMA MG2470) provide excellent printout as well as scan quality. It has easy to use feature, simple and clear. The software provide easy to use function. The packing is excellent an there is no damage even to the cardboard cover"
23679,5,"i received this printer much before the standard delivery date, kudos to flipkart for fastest delivery.  The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.  The Scanner works pretty wel..."
23680,5,I received the printer with excellent packing & with well managed system. I unpacked & gave trail colour print out of Ashtavinayak wikepedia.Excellent prints came out. I am happy with printer and service also.  Thanks & Regards. Sujit Kulkarni. For Renuka Tech
23681,5,Prints slowly but an awesome choice at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a printer at home. Flipkart does a great job in delevering the product on time with minimum hassle.
23682,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
23683,3,i m using this printer continiously abd just working fine ..... print and xerox speed is quite good ..... ink is very costly bt for home use this is perfect ..... as usual flipkart delivered me tgis product as the scheduled time ..... packaging is good enough for damage protection .....
23684,5,Very nice product awesome product for me print fine and scan very fine photo copy print good quality.....
23685,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
23686,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time

23714,5,bad product because its error prints
23715,4,very very very very good super
23716,4,After 10-20 copies the cartridge gets empty. You will have to buy a new ink cartridge @ RS 499 from Flipkart. So apparantly you will end up paying RS 25 per copy.
23717,5,verry good product
23718,1,"Product is very very nice. Scanning, copying and printing all the three operations are very accurate. Nice quality of all three features. Setup of printer is also very user friendly."

23731,5,amazing and super thank you filpkart
23732,1,nice work
23733,5,Please don't buy this printer.. the cartridge gets over after 20 prints and scanner sometimes strucks I would like to say you to go for a ink tank printer where you can add inks..
23734,4,wow after 8 months usage i sold this coz iNk prices 60% of the amount of printer !! Keep calm store money go with laser jet or something else which cartridge supports refilling QQ
23735,5,Good
23736,5,very good printer. printing quality is too good.
23737,1,please do not sale
23738,2,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
23739,4,by using two to three months its getting problems...
23740,5,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
23741,1,Very good product
23742,1,Not working properly..
23743,1,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
23744,1,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok
23745,5,for 1 month it is best printer but after one month it is so costly ink was RS.1000-2000
23746,1,"GOOD, GOOD , GOOD"
23747,5,Not able to print. Alarm lamp is continuously blinking despite correct installation of cartridges and paper alignment.
23748,1,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high

23777,5,Printer is working fine and output is also great but it is a ink eater eats lots of ink for a couple of pages. . Cartridges prices are sky high.Thus giving 4 stars.  Canon should at least think of its consumers a bit.

23922,5,"very bad exirence with delivery, packing and handiver.. had to struggle alot.. apart product it quite ok in this price.."
23923,4,not good product it only 30 pages to from the printer
23924,4,vary bad printer its cartaige was dry in one day
23925,3,Wroth of price
23926,2,to gud
23927,1,"one of the worst printer that I have ever used....don't try to buy it...if u did...u r dipping ur money in black ink... nozzel gets blocked by every other day... cartridge is very poor u can't refill it , so u have to buy a new one every time it gets exhausted....I am Regreting..."
23928,5,It gives very bad printing and it uses cartilage every day.
23929,5,Printers Price is good. Scanning are good. colour print out are 15-20 pages printed and ink cartridge over....
23930,1,Overall good...but loud sound while printing
23931,1,Very good printing...
23932,1,Super printer...üíúüíúüíú
23933,4,Refill very expensive.
23934,3,Don't buy it. Buy hp printer
23935,5,Too much poor quality of ink catridge.. Don't buy this product...
23936,5,It is an worst product the ink is for short time using
23937,2,Works well. Recommended for home use. No issues till now.
23938,1,"Though I got this printer at a very good price, I have had hard times using it. I have got cartidges changed twice despite using the printer for harday 100 copies."
23939,1,Good price good piece
23940,1,10 rupee per paper A4 SIZE
23941,5,Low price for home work
23942,1,Its very good product
23943,5,Very bad was not working
23944,2,Product is very nice for low costs h
23945,4,Only for emergency use & Scaner
23946,5,Good printing but cartridge is not maintaining briter ink capability
23947,1,Good product in this price. It is very good on use and quality.
23948,5,"It's a cheating seller , don't buy,"
23949,3,The printer is very good for printing and scanning @ home use. But its ink is expensive.
23950,2,"the performance of this printer in not good, printing speed is really bad and the main problem is the cartridge, it costs you too much every time and also not worth of the price."
23951,4,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
23952,1,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage
23953,5,I did not even give it one star .Very worst product. color print and black print does not print 10 pages also and it shows running on low ink . Never expected this from flipkart . I can't return it . Bad experience from flipkart. Worst printer ever .
23954,1,"Excellent printer, light weight, east to operate, ........................................................................................................."

Processing is also too late. 20 pages limit after one time filling. Totally money waste and which are mentioned credential about this printer is not all true
24637,3,Good working for middle levep managers use
24638,5,good

24646,1,Seal is broken bad product
24647,1,"Didn't meet expectations. Need to refill very frequently. While refilling it flows out from other end. Very less amount of ink remains inside cartridge resulting in printing for 15-20 papers only. And other issue is, even after refilling cartridge the yellow light will keep blinking. Would say don't go for this product."
24648,5,Faulty cartrige
24649,5,Very expensive
24650,1,"Waste Product, Ink over In 1month"
24651,3,It's really Good
24652,1,Its really good
24653,3,The 745s and 746s cartridges costs are too high for a refill. It comes just for 20 pages. Please rethink before you buy

24674,5,"This has many problems,if not for these problems this printer would have been perfect, it keeps disconnecting from my PC inspite of all instructions followed to the letter given on manual and once it disconnects I have to wait for hours, the ink cartridge is trash, it lasts only 100 pages,is that normal?, I used to own TVS printer, those cartridge lasts 1000 pages, now I am supposed to buy a new cartridge?? It's not suitable at all, the scanner works good and printing is bit slow, but due to ..."

24680,3,It's good
24681,5,Not worthy & less productive.
24682,5,lovely
24683,4,Never by this product. It is really swindling to rob the credulous customers by selling them a comparatively cheaper printer and then to charge an exorbitant and unaffordable and grossly disproportionate price for the printer cartridges. The printer is never returnable as well. NEVER EVER BUY AND FALL A PREY TO THE SELLERS CUNNING TACTICS.
24684,5,Very bad product. Cartridge finish within 20 pages print. And the cartridge is not refilling. If the cartridge is finished you need to buy a new cartridge Which price is 700 and above. And no. off-page is very less in printing. Almost your per copy print approx Rs10-12 each in black.
24685,1,Printer bad working
24686,5,Very poor not working ink error .even after refilling
24687,1,This printer is very nice
24688,1,"Frankly speaking Guyzz don't buy this as for student purpose/home purpose because the cartridges is too costly and in one cartridge give only 50 sheets Afterall the printer is very good there is no doubt but not for as student purpose overall cost will be 10,000 in that you go for ink tank printers it will save you atleast you don't have to buy costly cartridges. Thank you ."

25662,4,Please don't buy this product. 1 took only one print then it's stopped to work
25663,5,It is not good
25664,3,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less
25665,4,Spr
25666,1,Very good quality and nice model Satisfied
25667,1,"Printer works fine, but i would recommned not to buy this as the cartridges are very expensive."
25668,1,Don't buy it. The reason is printer cartige is very costly. One cartige you will printer 20 or 25 pages only and the cost of Black Cartage is 775/-.

25707,5,Printing quality is awesome but the cost of printing is too much so if your printing work is not much then definitely you can go for this but if you have to print more then the cost of cartridge will definitely be high for you as it just prints approax 50 pages in a single cartridge so do consider this point before buying..

29763,1,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..

Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy ink tank printers as they are too efficient"

29942,5,Pro's: Setup was very easy. Size is compact. Print quality is good for price point. Cons: Printing speed is very slow. Specially full page printouts take a lot of time. Build quality is very clumsy. All plastics and buttons rattle. Cartridge is very expensive. So printing will be limited to only basic use.

30407,5,It is a amazing monitor. It supports fhd and suitable for you gaming consoles or pc.
30408,5,"This is a very standard 18.5 inches Monitor from Dell. There is one important information needs to be added that the power source cable of the monitor comes with a 16A plug and it is not possible to connect to our standard UPS. Hence either the cable needs to be replaced or the monitor needs to be connected to 16A plug point, which will not help during power cut. Due to this, I have not yet been able to check/test the visuals and performance of the monitor. Hope to update my review soon once ..."

30445,4,Excellent product.. delivery was on time.. delivery person behavior was too good..I am very much satisfied with the product ??
30446,1,"Overall I am quite satisfied and happy with the monitor. The only reason I am give 4 star is due to the fact that the power cable that this monitor uses is a 16A one. This was a surprise as I did not expect a monitor to have a 16A input cable l. Had to buy a converter to get it working. This delayed the use by couple of days more. But other than that, this is a very good buy"

30495,2,"Product is good. It was available for Rs 500 less next day after ordering so felt cheated. Also beware it has 16A power cord (which is used for devices like Refrigerator, Washing machine) so it wont fit in your regular socket."
30496,5,The power plug/pin is too big.. does not fit anywhere. It's bigger than required for a refrigerator. Don't know why it requires so much power. ..The monitor is just okay but worth the price

30704,4,"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:- 1)vga cable 2) HDMI cable 3) stand for screen 4) screen 5) power cable 6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops) So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins. So here are some pros a..."
30705,4,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."
30706,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
30707,5,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
30708,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.

30710,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
30711,4,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."
30712,5,Proudly Saying take it as early as possible if you think to take any monitor....kindly go for it without any hesitation and too much thinking.... today it's arrived at my place and after installation really I just wondered to see bcz it's fully screen and when I started a video in YouTube with highest resolution I just wondered to see what Crystal clear picture I can't explain and when I start a high resolution game it's give me my dream picture of the characters and others features was tooo...
30713,5,"Do not think twice before purchasing it some will say lg display is good samsung is better, it has a response time of 7 ms which is slower than usual and u are here searching for an IPS panel monitor it clears that u want a good picture quality and video experience so go for it don't listen to any other if u take it then u will give a review here like me.."
30714,5,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."
30715,5,"Awsome quality, best moniter in this price, perfect & true color for photo & video, best moniter for photoshop working & video editing.. Loved it.. Thanku flipkart.. Flipkart service is very good before time delivery i loved it."

The color scheme of silver and bezel less scheme make other monitors in 24 inch look ordinary. A 5 star from me."
30741,4,The description of this product is incorrect in Flipkart. This screen is a Full HD screen (1080p). Awesome color representation. Very thin. Very good design. Best product in the range.

31074,5,best product
31075,5,"Excellent product in budget .i m loving it.i prefer this for who is finding home theater for his L.E.D ,laptop or computer ,"
31076,5,Its good in this price range but if you are looking for a high definition sound clarity so this is not for you and as of its cost it is best as per my opinion. one thing more bluetooth range is only 5 to 6 mts so keep this in mind before choosing this.
31077,5,"Writing this review after using 4 days.. No doubt its best sound system under this price segment. Let me tell u first, over all in this price segment this intex 4.1 channel home theater is super good. Really impressed with the sound üîä quality and Bass is very high. What more can u expect at this price. After all its brand intex. Over all you can buy this product with no doubt. You will get all necessary features.  CONNECTIVITY FEATURES ***  Bluetooth (10 m.

31078,5,Brilliant excellent performance thank you Flipkart I am use 10 days super product
31079,5,Nice product. Bluetooth connectivity are very good and long distance. This speaker is suitable for small rooms in very nice experience. In this price very best quality. Very small product but sounds unbelievable. Sound very clear and good. 1 sub woofer 15 w 4 satellite speakers √ó 10 w = 4 w So Total 55 w 4.1 HOME THEATRE SYSTEM
31080,4,"Ordered this and next day delivered (Rs.1699.00) Flipkart packaging is not good in this item only a poly pack but delivered without any damages and got recently manufactured product Oct/2020.  About this product: 1) Subwoofer Bass 5/5 2) Satellite speaker 3/5 Sound is good but it is mentioned 10 X 4 = 40 watt, it sounds like total output of about 10-15 watt only except subwoofer not because the speaker but inbuilt circuit board. Although this home theatre's sound is enough for me (12X10 room..."
31081,4,Nice product. Nice sound. The advantage is it have led light and 4 speaker
31082,5,Completely mind blowing speaker more than my expectations and pocket friendly I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.... Very good all features work perfectly and fluent..!!
31083,5,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box.. If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it. If u want a home theater effect dont go for it. While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.
31084,5,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.
31085,5,"Good design.. I bought it in1500 so in this price ""value for money "" But according 55watt speakern i dont think its sound Average product ...but ok & perfect for this prise range Edited rivew after 6 month use i dont think it is a good product BASE Is good bt the vocal & noice is very bad sound like 10 watt blootooth sepaker"
31086,5,"Good product valuable for money I like it, if u selecting for a better quality home theater under cheapest rate I preferd for u this b/s it's good and good quality one"

33267,5,"First of all I am not recommending to buy this item due to following reasons:  1) Even though it is having 4 antennas, the range, I mean the strength of the Wifi signal is very much less than that of Netgear / TP Link routers with single antenna.  2) Most of the tools or features in the MiWifi app are not working.  3) Connectivity details are in China Language as usual.  4) It is very difficult to search for a password. Since No where it is mentioned.  5) Very difficult to mount on the wall. ..."
33268,5,These Router is just awesome.. I have used Mi Router 3c and now i ordered this one 4c.. This one is just an upgrade to the other one. But it works fine.. Not a single.issue till now using 3c from about a year and 6 months.. Using thia one from past 3 days the speed is good as per my plan no problems with any connections.. Look is also good but the thing which stops me to buy is the Company which is basically a chinese brand.. This is my last thing which i will be purchasing that is made in ch...
33269,5,"Smart features,looks is also impressive and app optimization is so good I like the overall extraordinary product."
33270,5,Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router
33271,1,Genuinely MI products are good and I am using all the products of Mi And I need to say about the MI router is after 2 weeks of usage is suddenly shut down and it is not even blinking the lights on top of Mi router I have seen a big issue with this MI router and I want to suggest you people to take the other best companies for your router I am saying genuinely to you all you have buying to take this product From Hyderabad Alwal
33272,4,"Just like a normal router, works well and as expected but nothing special.  It has those basic features as of all routes which includes :- 1. Bandwidth Control for some devices 2. Hiding the network SSID 3. Total data monitoring   However, even thought it as 4 antennas, the range is very low (I am not running it on 5 GHz otherwise it will be much lower). When I go onto rooftop (just above my room) the signal drops and only 1 bar of signal is available. Not to mention it only covers the place ..."
33273,5,GOOD PRODUCT & SOME CONS  MIWIFI QUALITY IS SUPER SOLID PERFORMANCE IS ALSO BEST AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT ROUTER HAS NEW FEATURE CALLED SIGNAL WALL PENETRATE MODE ALSO YOU CAN WIFI CONTROL APP (MIWIFI) FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE BUT ONLY I HAVE ONE ISSUE [CHINESE PRODUCTS MOSTLY SPYING YOUR DATA SO MAYBE IT'S ALSO SPYING OR NOT ]
33274,5,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n
33275,1,It's really awesome products nice design with good inbuilt feature makes it a pro level WiFi router as I have at the moment 2 system working as we are working from home also 6 other mobiles are connected but I am getting a good speed to all the connections.
33276,3,Wonderful purchase!!! üòÉüòÉ The best product at this price... There is no router at this price this good... Lookswise also very sleek and elegant ‚ù§‚ù§ very happy! Must buy!!! üíï
33277,5,Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.
33278,3,"Using it as a range extender (wired) , woking like a charm for me, Myth about ping ,it depends on your location like if you live in metro cities your ping will be very low (because metero cities have Larger number of servers) but if you live in small cities or town (like me) no matter which connection you buy your ping will never match with metero cities( because firstly our city server send their data to these metro cities server) trust me I've have tried many FTTH connection and never get..."

33280,5,Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.
33281,5,The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.  Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough
33282,5,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only. Its a good router u have app support as well. Very good interface u can easily check if any unwanted one is using ur router. Good to have .....go for it .... Vfm (value for money) for sure ..!!
33283,5,"I am writing this review after one month of uses of the another great product from xiomi... First of all the interface of the app to access the router is very simple.. keep is mind if you need more than 2 lan port this product is surely not for you, otherwise blindly go for it... If you have big house like me then it is the best router you can get to cover all the rooms.."
33284,5,"I am happy that it is serving the basic purpose. I have been using it from one week, I haven't disconnected to internet yet, my past router I used to disconnect minimum once in a day, liked it totally. I haven't check for WIPS and MAC filtering, will post soon once I checked that.  Pros: ->Looks are good ->Good range. Serving me for 2 floors with one 3 BHK flat in each floor ->3 lan ports -> Can be easily setup just by seeing the manual not even required to check the CD  Cons: ->Can't be moun..."

33286,5,works fine with the 300mbps connection. sometimes it needs a re-start after a few days. and it's good to go. range it not too much but it's good for a small apartment or flat. not suitable for an office or whole floor.
33287,5,"Good enough for 2 BHK and has good range i guess up to 40 meters i guessüëç, i have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and it's pretty good no issues till now, the setting up was easy as in the manual, the speed is also great üëçüëå"
33288,2,"When you search for Routers online, you have so many options available with so many different price tags. Also you are sceptical whether you should buy them online or not, fearing the workability. But I can tell you one thing with assurance that this product is excellent. Be it the simplicity in the looks, workability, long term usage and durability. And yeah! its working still fine after more than 1 year of usage."
